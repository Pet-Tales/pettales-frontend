      "question5": "Can I edit the story after it's created?",
      "answer5": "Yes! You can edit both the story text and regenerate illustrations if you're not satisfied with the results. You also have the option to regenerate individual pages or the entire book with different settings.",
      "question6": "Is my personal information and pet photos secure?",
      "answer6": "Absolutely. We take privacy seriously and use industry-standard security measures to protect your data. Your photos and personal information are encrypted and stored securely. We never share your personal data with third parties.",
      "question7": "What languages are supported?",
